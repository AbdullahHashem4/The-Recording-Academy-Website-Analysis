# The Recording Academy Website Analysis- Portfolio Project ðŸŽ¶ 
## Global Tech Experience Internship - Intro to Data Analytics 

**Introduction:**
The project involves analyzing real data from both websites owned by The Recording Academy, the non-profit organization behind the Grammy Awards. The websites were split into grammy.com and recordingacademy.com to cater to different audience needs. The goal is to examine the effect of this split and analyze data trends and audience behavior on both sites.

**Data Preparation and Transformation:**
- Grammys Data: The analysis began with the Grammys Data sheet, containing various data points provided by The Recording Academy.
- Task 1a: A line chart was created to visualize the number of daily visitors to the Grammy.com website, identifying spikes corresponding to Grammy Awards hosting days.
- Task 1b: Analysis of the graph revealed a surge in daily visitors during Grammy Awards hosting days.
- Task 2a: A PivotTable compared average daily website visitors on Grammy Awards ceremony days to regular days.
- Task 2b: The analysis indicated a significant increase in visitors during Grammy Awards ceremonies, approximately 1,326,201 more visitors on average.
- Task 3: The website_content column in the Grammys Data sheet was updated to reflect the transition date (February 1st, 2022) when Grammy.com began hosting only Grammys content.

**Business KPI Calculation:**
- Part 2: The project involved calculating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess the impact of splitting the websites.
- Tasks 4-6: Metrics such as pages per session, bounce rate, and average time on site were calculated for the Recording Academy, Grammys, and Grammys + TRA data.
- Task 7: Device breakdown analysis determined the percentage of visitors from mobile devices across all dates in the dataset.

**Communicating Findings:**
- Task 8: Based on the analysis, a recommendation was made regarding whether the websites should stay separate. Insights highlighted differences in user engagement metrics, suggesting potential benefits of maintaining separate websites tailored to audience preferences.
- Task 9: Feedback was provided on key metrics relative to the competitor, American Music Awards (AMAs), indicating stronger user engagement metrics for the Grammys website.
- LevelUp Task: An A/B test was conducted to determine if the difference in pages per session between "Grammys + TRA" content and Recording Academy data was statistically significant, with the null hypothesis rejected based on the p-value.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of splitting the websites and highlighted the importance of tailored content and user experiences. Recommendations focused on optimizing user engagement and mobile experience, ultimately aiming to enhance the overall success of The Recording Academy's online platforms.
